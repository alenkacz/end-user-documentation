# Rug CLI Commands and Syntax

This page documents syntax and functionality of the Rug CLI.

*Note:* All commands listed below are provided only as examples of the
syntax.  They may refer to Rugs and Rug archives or projects that do not exist 
and therefore may not work.

## Configuring

In order to use the CLI the following file named `cli.yml` needs to be
placed in `~/.atomist`.  The contents of the simplest possible
`cli.yml` are below.

```yaml
# Set up the path to the local repository
local-repository:
  path: "${user.home}/.atomist/repository"

# Set up remote repositories to query for Rug archives. Additionally one of the
# repositories can also be enabled for publication (publish: true).
remote-repositories:
  maven-central:
    publish: false
    url: "http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/"
  rug-types:
    publish: false
    url: "https://atomist.jfrog.io/atomist/libs-release"
  rugs:
    publish: false
    url: "https://atomist.jfrog.io/atomist/rugs-release"
```

The Rug CLI will create the above `cli.yml` if you do not already have
one.

## Commands

The CLI will assume the current working directory to be the root for execution.

### Using the CLI as Rug users

#### Invoking Editors

Run an editor as follows:

```shell
$ rug edit atomist-rugs:common-editors:AddReadme --artifact-version 1.0.0 \
    parameter1=foo parameter2=bar

$ rug edit atomist-rugs:common-editors:AddReadme parameter1=foo parameter2=bar
```

`artifact-version` is optional and defaults to `latest` semantics.
`--change-dir` or `-C` for giving a generator a target directory.

#### Invoking Generators

```shell
$ rug generate atomist-rugs:spring-boot-rest-service:NewSpringBootRestService" \
    --artifact-version 1.0.0 my-new-project parameter1=foo parameter2=bar

$ rug generate atomist-rugs:spring-boot-rest-service:NewSpringBootRestService" \
    my-new-project parameter1=foo parameter2=bar
```

`artifact-version` is optional and defaults to `latest` semantics.
`--change-dir` or `-C` for giving a generator a target directory.

#### Describing Rug Artifacts

To get information about a Rug and list all its parameters, run the
`rug describe` command.

```shell
$ rug describe archive atomist-rugs:spring-rest-service

$ rug describe editor atomist-rugs:spring-boot-rest-service:SpringBootThing \
    --artifact-version 1.0.0

$ rug describe generator atomist-rugs:spring-boot-rest-service:NewSpringBootThing \
    --artifact-version 1.0.0
```

#### Listing Local Archives

To list all locally available Rug archives, run the `rug list`
command:

```shell
$ rug list -f 'version=[1.2,2.0)' -f 'group=*atomist*' -f 'artifact=*sp?ing*'
```

The local listing can be filtered by using `-f` filter expressions on
`group`, `artifact` and `version`. `group` and `artifact` support
wildcards of `*` and `?`.  `version` takes any version constraint.

### Using the CLI as Rug developer

All the following commands need to executed from within the Rug
project directory.

#### Running Tests

To run all tests:

```shell
$ rug test
```

To run a specific named test:

```shell
$ rug test "Whatever Test Secanrio"
```

To run all scenarios from a .rt file:

```shell
$ rug test MyRugTestFilename
```

#### Installing a Rug archive

Creating a Rug zip archive and installing it into the local repository
can be done with the following command:

```shell
$ rug install
```

This command packages the project into a zip archive, creates a Pom
and installs both into the local repository under, usually
`.atomist/repository`.

## Dependency Resolution

The Rug CLI will automatically resolve and download the dependencies
of the given Rug archive when `edit` or `generate` is invoked. The
archives along with their dependencies will be downloaded to a local
repository under `~/.atomist` via Aether and resolved from there.

Therefore running above commands is a two step process:

1.  Search and resolve (eventually download) the archive referenced in
    the command.  The result of a resolution is cached for 60
    minutes. You can force re-resolution with the `-r` command-line
    option.
2.  Start up `rug-lib` passing parameters over to run the editor or
    generator

## Advanced Topics

### Turning on Verbose output for Debugging

If you want a more verbose output that includes any exceptions that
Rug command may have encountered, please add `-X` to your command.
For example:

```shell
$ rug test -X
```
