Rug Templates are files that contain parameterized content that can be
used by Rug [generators](rug-generators.md)
and [editors](rug-editors.md).  Templates are located in the
`.atomist/templates` directory.

Currently Rug supports using
both [Velocity](https://velocity.apache.org/)
and [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) styles of template.
Velocity templates must have a `.vm` extension.  Mustache templates
must have a `.mustache` extension.
