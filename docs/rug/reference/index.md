best practices.

## Rug Language Extensions

[Core Rug Language Extensions](extensions/index.md) define a set of core concepts that
Rug understands.  This understanding provides you with an API for
accessing and manipulating these files rather than having to do raw
file manipulation.  See the documentation for each of the [Core Rug Language Extensions](extensions/index.md)
for details on what each API allows you to do.

## Rug Conventions

The [Rug Conventions][conventions] provide a set of best practices
when developing Rugs.
