Atomist is all about high quality productivity for your software.
Whether it be working with large legacy codebases, your own "majestic
monoliths" or aiming for "zero overhead microservices", Atomist
provides the tools that allow you to turn your development speed up as
high as it can go.

Atomist helps you develop better software more quickly by automating
common tasks in software development and operation.  This automation
takes several forms:

-   Creating a RESTful microservice with a single click using an
    Atomist Button.
-   Using Rug editors to perform common tasks on your source code
    repository, e.g., configuring and enabling a [Travis CI][travis]
    build or updating a [Docker][docker] base image to the desired
    version.
-   Ensuring a project conforms with your standards using a Rug
    reviewer.
-   Managing a service life cycle, from commits to CI builds to
    deployments and releases to alerts and corrective action with the
    Atomist Bot.

You can find more detail on what Atomist can do by following our
Medium Publication: [The Composition][composition].  In
particular, [Software That Writes And Evolves Software][evolve]
provides a more detailed introduction to our thinking around
development automation and a video showing an application of the
approach to the [Elm][elm]
language.  [Understand, Automate, Collaborate][collab] provides more
detail on how our approach can greatly increase a team's productivity.

While often our Atomist Bot can guide you through the proper workflow,
perhaps you are interested in working with the Rug CLI, looking for a
little more help to get started with Atomist, or doing something more
advanced like writing your own editor.  If that is what you're looking
for, you're in the right place.
